- Remove relative imports from the project. ts-node doesn't like tsconfig lib paths though, maybe drop using oclif altogether?
- remove axios and use native fetch
- oclif packages are deprecated.
- OTP flow is a lot of back and forth (confusing for first time user).
- bun js would be cool, fast start. but node-pty doesn't work with it.
